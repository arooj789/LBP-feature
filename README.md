Installation Guidelines: To install and use this MATLAB LBP feature extraction code, you can follow these general guidelines:

• Install MATLAB: To run the MATLAB LBP feature extraction code, you need to have MATLAB installed on your computer. If you do not have MATLAB, you can download and install it from the MathWorks website.

• Install the Image Processing Toolbox: The LBP feature extraction function in MATLAB is part of the Image Processing Toolbox. If you do not have the Image Processing Toolbox installed, you need to install it. You can install it using the "Add-Ons" menu in MATLAB.

• Download the code from Github: Once you have MATLAB and the Image Processing Toolbox installed, you can download this MATLAB LBP feature extraction code from Github. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

• Add the code folder to MATLAB path: In MATLAB, you need to add the folder containing the LBP feature extraction code to the MATLAB path. You can do this by clicking on the "Set Path" button in the MATLAB toolbar, selecting "Add Folder" and then browsing to the folder containing the LBP feature extraction code.

• Open the MATLAB code in MATLAB: Open MATLAB on your computer and navigate to the folder where you downloaded the LBP feature extraction code. Double-click on the .m file to open it in MATLAB.

• Run the code: To run the code, simply click on the "Run" button in the MATLAB editor or type the name of the script in the MATLAB command window.

Setup Configuration: The setup configuration for this MATLAB LBP feature extraction code may depend on the specific requirements of the code and dataset, but here are some general guidelines that you can follow:

• Image Dataset: You will need an image dataset on which you want to perform the LBP feature extraction. The images should be in a compatible format such as JPEG or PNG.

• Dataset Directory: In the first line of the code, you need to change the path 'E:\maize plants' to the path of your dataset directory.

• Parameter Configuration: The LBP feature extraction code does not have any configurable parameters in this implementation.

• Output Configuration: The output of the LBP feature extraction code will be a matrix F, where each row represents the feature vector for an image in the dataset, and the last column represents the label of that image.

• Execution Environment: The LBP feature extraction code does not have any specific hardware or software requirements.

Manual: This MATLAB LBP feature extraction code takes an input dataset directory, extracts LBP features from each image in the dataset, trains a support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) model on the extracted features, and demonstrates the classification of a single image using the trained models.

To use this code, you need to provide the path of the dataset directory in the first line of the code, where the 'imageDatastore' function reads the images from the dataset. The code extracts LBP features from each image and stores them in a matrix F, where each row represents the feature vector for an image in the dataset, and the last column represents the label of that image.

The code then trains an SVM model and a KNN model on the extracted features using the 'fitcsvm' and 'fitcknn' functions, respectively. Finally, the code demonstrates the classification of a single image using the trained models. You can uncomment the last few lines of the code to test the classification of a single image.

Note that this implementation does not include any validation or testing of the trained models, and it is recommended to split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets for a more thorough evaluation of the models
